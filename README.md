# deployer-iam-policies
Restrictive AWS IAM Policies for the Domino Deployer's "rancher" installs

These are IAM policies that attempt to minimize the permissions required to perform a Domino deployment. This functionality was moved into the deployer itself. Please see `resources/deployer/terraform/iam-deployment-policies` in the deployer.
